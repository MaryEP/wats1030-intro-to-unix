The following goals are meant to provide a way for more 
experienced users to
extend their knowledge of the *nix command line.


* Use `curl` to look up the URL
`http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070948/`. 
The title of this film will lead you to the answer. 
*What is the answer?*
>>I tried this multiple times and received two options but no answer:

>> 1 Data returns really fast but I can't stop the screen from scrolling so I couldn't read the title or other info.
 >> looks like grep and find only return local files

>> 2 Where's the page, Lebowski?
>> <div id="error" class="error_code_404">                                                                                          
    <div class="error_message">                                                                                                  
        The requested URL was not found on our server. <a href="/">Go to the IMDb homepage</a> &raquo;

    <div class="error_bubble">
